#### Hackathon to build a React-Native Game
---------

#### Web Site + NodeJS Backend

Hi Peeps! 

This is a Create React App install in order to develop the website for the application.
Here we'll run the front-end of the website and the nodejs backend.

The React Native App will connect to the nodejs backend to extract and insert data into the db.

Please clone it and have fun hacking around!
